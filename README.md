# Digital-Electronics-Core-Prep

Methods to prepare for internship / placement related tests and interviews in Digital Electronics based on my seniors' and colleagues' guidance plus my personal experience. I have been offered a job at Samsung Hardware via campus placements from BITS Goa during the Placement Cycle of SEM-1 2022-23, and will be adding questions and sharing experiences from my placement process. Kindly note that this is NOT an exhaustive list, however, it will prepare you for Placement related tests in a very good manner.

## How to approach my core prep?
Studying for a core job may become exhausting and feel never-ending, inspite of putting in countless hours of effort for clearing your concepts. First of all, note that studying electronics for interest and studing for placements are two different things. Here, you will be supposed to solve multiple questions within a limmited time frame, quite similar to what you did during your JEE days. The way that electronics is taught in college is not done keeping campus placements in mind, hence a lot of us tend to go into these tests with the appropriate knowledge, but seldom do very well because of lack of practice in the pattern of giving these tests. 

The material that I have shared is crisp, concise, strictly placement oriented, and can be covered within a month. I was myself able to cover everything that I have attached in one month, hence I am not claiming anything that I have not tried out myself. Having said that, we will be breaking down the placement process on the basis of importance of topics weightage-wise:-
1. Digital Design
2. Computer Architecture
3. Digital VLSI Design
4. C Programming
5. Verilog
6. Microprocessors and Embedded Systems
7. Miscalleneous

Material and instructions for approaching each topic have been shared with the folders attached. 
Please feel free to contact me for suggestions in adding/removing resources and/or if there are any mistakes in the material(s) provided.
